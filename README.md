# GNSS-SDRLIB-PVT_WBS_121625
Modified version of GNSS-SDRLIB

Versions:
1. GNSS-SDRLIB-PVT_BLS_042725. Released 4/27/25. Uses SDL2 for GUI and has BLS for the PVT 
estimation.
2. GNSS-SDRLIB-PVT_BLS_052425. Released 5/25/25. Several modifications that significantly
improve robustness. SDL2 has been replaced by Ncurses for GUI. The SV channels now reset
themselves by zeroing out structs and flags, rather than closing and restarting each
channel (thread). The BLS (batch least squares) PVT filter has been replaced with a weigthed
BLS (WLS) filter.
3. GNSS-SDRLIB-PVT_WLS_121625. Released 12/16/25. This version now works with four SDR front
ends: RTLSDR, BladeRF, HackRF One, and HydraSDR. It will also read playback files from these
four. Other code cleanup was done as well. As a note, the HydraSDR seems to perform especially
well, as the signal seems very strong and clean. 

Purpose. This is a significantly-modifed version of GNSS-SDRLIB. Instead of requiring a 
TCP link to RTKLIB for positioning, it has its own least squares solver built-in. 

Limitations. This is a highly stripped-down version of GNSS-SDRLIB, in an attempt to 
create a more truly real-time and robust GPS SDR. This version is GPS L1 only, Linux only 
(not Windows), and only currently works with RTLSDR or bladeRF front ends.
